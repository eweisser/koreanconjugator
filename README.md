# koreanconjugator
An effort to automate Korean verb "conjugation"--or inflection, at any rate. We'll see how it goes!

The idea is to find Unicode key point patterns in Korean syllabic blocks that conjugate similarly (for example, syllabic blocks that end in -르, other vowels, -ㄷ, etc.), define them mathematically, and then "calculate" the Unicode corresponding to the correct conjugation. It's all in Javascript.

Inflection is probably a better word than conjugation here, but oh well!
